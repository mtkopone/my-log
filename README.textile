** You have sent an SMS to
* This list is ordered latest communication first
* A single phone number or contact is only listed once, according to the most recent communication

h3. Motivation

Having gotten used to Nokia UI's, my first instinct when calling someone was to "push the green button", and then select the contact or phone number from the list. 

The call log in my Nexus One didn't really fill that requirement since it took 2 clicks to get there and it was an actual _log_ of each call.

And I wanted to see how easy it would be to write for Android using Scala:http://www.scala-lang.org/ . It was.
